<h1>Shooting ducks - a classic fairground favourite</h1>
<h2>A simple, silly game â€” yet it increases your conversion!</h2>
<p>Include this game in your webshop and have your customers win prizes, such as different discount levels or free products.</p>
<p>The game has been made with CSS3 and jQuery. Mainly, the clicks and counters are jQuery while the animations are pure CSS. When speed is involved, it has built-in variables to easily adjust speed or difficulty level so you won't lose customers. But even then, hey, a booby prize can still be worth a product sample or free shipping!</p>
